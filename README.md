The project demonstrates the ability to:

* Design a feature-focused product from scratch
* Build clean, maintainable full-stack architecture
* Balance UI/UX decisions with backend scalability
* Think in terms of MVP → iteration → expansion

This repository reflects practical engineering skills, product thinking, and the ability to deliver a complete, working application rather than isolated features.
